Then the application shuts down.\n\n# Requirements\n\n* [Android SDK](developer.android.com)\n\n# Building\n\n    $ cd into/this/repo\n    $ ant debug\n\nYou can also run `ant debug install` to build and immediately deploy the app to a connected Android device or emulator.\n\n# Running\n\nOnce installed on a device, turn the device's screen off. If you have a security lock on your device, turning the screen off will\nalso enable the security lock.\n\nNow to see the magic:\n\n    $ adb shell am start -n io.appium.unlock/.Unlock\n\nVoila! Your device or emulator is awake and unlocked!\n\n# License\n\nApache License 2.0 \n",
